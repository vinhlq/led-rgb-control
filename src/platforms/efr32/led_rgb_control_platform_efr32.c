*
* Version 1.00
*
* Description:
*   This file contains the definitions of the low-level APIs. You may need to 
*   modify the content of these APIs to suit your host processorâ€™s I2C 
*   implementation.
*
* Note:
*   These host-dependent Low Level APIs are provided as an example of
*   low level I2C read and write functions. This set of low level APIs are 
*   written for PSoC 4200/4100 devices and hence should be re-written
*   with equivalent host-dependent APIs from the respective IDEs, if the 
*   host design does not include PSoC 4200/4100 device.
* 
*   To use these APIs, the host should implement a working I2C communication
*   interface. This interface will be used by these APIs to communicate to the
*   CY8CMBR3xxx device.
*
*   For PSoC 4200/4100 devices, please ensure that you have created an instance 
*   of SCB component with I2C Master configuration. The component should be
*   named "SCB".
